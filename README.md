# Press demo

A minimal demonstration of static publishing with Webpack and [Press][].

```bash
# Before you get going
npm install
```

## Development mode
```bash
# Run a development server on port 8080
npm run dev
```
Press will emit new HTML whenever [markdown][] or [templates][] change and 
trigger a live reload.

## Production build
```bash
# Create a production build in the /dist
npm run build

# Serve the /dist directory on 8080
npm run serve
```
